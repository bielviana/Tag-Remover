# Tag-Remover
Very simple script to remove specific strings from a list of files, useful for those who download compiled files from websites and in the name of each file there is "[SITE_NAME]" at the beginning.

## How to use
1. Download the latest release version [HERE](https://github.com/pySiriusDev/Tag-Remover/releases).
2. Copy the **`Tag_Remover.exe`** file into the folder where the files to be renamed are located.
3. Make sure this folder contains only the files you want to rename and the **Tag_Remover.exe**
4. Run the **`Tag_Remover.exe`** file, enter the text you want to remove from the filenames and press enter.

**If there is a space between the text you want to remove and the actual file name, enter the space as well.**<br>
Example:
```
    File name: "[GOOGLE.COM] File.txt"
    Text to remove: "[GOOGLE.COM] " instead of "[GOOGLE.COM]" (Type without quotes)
    Renamed file: "File.txt"
```
